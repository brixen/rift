Ruby Information Flow Tool analyses Ruby code for possible security
vulnerabilities. It is based on ideas from Cift presented by Joe Hurd
at a Galois (galois.com) tech talk.

Rift suggests the crack, split, or break in your application's security
model. Its goal is to identify information flow that may disclose
confidential information.

Rift is built for Rubinius, leveraging the bytecode compiler which is
written in Ruby.
